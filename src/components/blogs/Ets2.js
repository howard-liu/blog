      <h2 id="ets2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</h2>
      You drive a fake a truck, to earn fake money, to relax after doing real
      work. Makes sense?
      <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>I think I always knew about the
      existence of this game, but I never thought it was never any good or that
      I would ever buy it. This changed because of CGP Grey. For him, it was a
      way to relax after videos are released, and he has some livestreams of it
      under his belt too. I watched a couple of his livestream VODs and got
      sucked into it. I'm not actually sure why. It was a guy driving across
      pretend Europe in his pretend truck. But his relaxing stream really
      captured me and drew me into the Trucksim world.
      <h3 id="firstimpressions">First Impressions</h3>
      The combination of the sightseeing, progression and general driving really
      appealed to me and drew me right into the game. Not going to lie, I had
      some late "just one more job" nights the first weekend. The effect of
      having generally samey sights makes special events even more surprising
      and memorable. I recall turning a curve, and the trees parted to reveal
      the Swiss Alps (I think). My jaw just dropped. It would not have been the
      same experience if I just saw a picture of it. There was something there
      that was extremely gratifying about discovering new places, similar to a
      road trip in real life. I love to have some audio on in the background as
      I drive. I prefer podcasts, but some good ol' road trip music is great
      too.  After a little getting used to the controls, I could basically focus
      my thinking part of the brain purely on the podcast (mostly Cortex at this
      time) while driving almost autonomously.
      <h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
      There is some debate on which control method is best. I can't afford a
      steering wheel, so that's out of the question for me. And WASD is just too
      imprecise for this game. As I am playing on a laptop, my choices are the
      trackpad and the mouse. I have a Logitech M705 as my mouse of choice,
      which has 2 thumb buttons which I assigned to be accelerate and brake, and
      the scroll wheel is used for controlling the cruise control. This allows
      me to drive with one hand, which frees me physically and relaxes me
      mentally too. I definitely enjoy this method as it is similar to cruising
      along with an actual steering wheel. However this does have its downsides.
      Mainly it's the problem with the lack of stability. I like resting my
      wrist on the table and using that as a pivot. This is for stability during
      straightaways and small turns. I've turned the sensitivity as far down as
      I feel comfortable with for larger turns, yet the tiniest movement still
      turns way too much. This is important during highway driving which takes
      up most of the time in this game. Maybe it's just because my mouse
      control's not that great. I try to combat this by resting the outer side
      of my hand and pinky on the mousepad and using that as the pivot. But
      again, it’s still finicky and not very fluid. So in the end I actually use
      the trackpad the most when driving. The trackpad solves the problem with
      regards to accuracy and stability because you rest your finger on the
      trackpad at (nearly) all times, meaning small movements with the finger is
      much easier and controllable than the mouse and it’s much more comfortable
      to stay still this way. Gameplay wise, I enjoy the trackpad more. However,
      it does have its issues. One of them being the potential for repetitive
      strain injury, which I didn’t feel on the mouse. I felt a bit of strain
      after playing a whole afternoon. I found that using the first finger to be
      worse than using the middle finger. Another much less significant problem
      is that you basically have to drive 2 handed, only 1 handed when you have
      cruise control set up already.
      <h3 id="review">Review</h3>
      After around a month, I still find trucking just as enjoyable. It allows
      me to enjoy stimulating conversations from people around the internet
      while my mind rests and relaxes through enjoying the view and driving
      smoothly across Europe. I can talk about the attention to detail that you
      realise as you cross into different countries like license plate changes,
      different environment, weather systems, traffic lights. Or I can complain
      about some issues like some of the copy and paste landscape, sometimes
      scarily annoying AI, minor loading issues/glitches etc, but this is not
      what I want to talk about. So far, I have 42 hours on ETS, which is not a
      lot and I know that my perspective may change in a while, but I think
      there is little stopping ETS becoming my most played game on Steam. I
      currently enjoy the game a great deal and there is plenty of 'progression'
      left with buying garages, upgrades and other trucks and workers. This does
      not change what I'm doing, but gives me plenty of things to work towards.
      Not only that, there are a myriad of DLCs available I haven't bought, as
      well as American Truck Simulator. Another thing I enjoy is playing in
      Rambo style, where I drive as fast as I can. This ups the excitement and
      difficulty as you need to keep an eye out for cops and try to round
      corners as effectively as possible as not to flip. This changes the pace
      when I crave some excitement.
      <h3 id="whyiloveets2">Why I love ETS2</h3>I have already talked about my
      enjoyment of the gameplay and environment. But I think the main downside
      of this game is also it's major strength. It's boring. This menial task
      allows my brain to rest from thinking about study. With other games I have
      played in the past, I would be completely consumed by it. For example,
      last year I played Civilisations V and the first semester of this year I
      played Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Both of these games are so much
      more entertaining than ETS2, but they have major detriment to my working
      life. There's a lot of time needed in game to spend in practice and out of
      the game, my brain is used in thinking about and remembering strategies.
      Totally engrossed, this affected all aspects of my life, including health.
      I would recommend myself play these high intensity, entertaining games in
      the holidays when there aren't anything better to do. What I find special
      and most crucial about this game, is that, it does not <em>keep</em> me
      hooked. After a couple of missions, I feel that I come back to myself,
      feeling sated, allowing me to go back to work whatever I need to. It's
      like eating something unhealthy which portions itself for you, while
      providing all the enjoyment that you would want. Guilt free fun. As my Dad
      says, control your technology or watch it control you.
      <h3 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h3>I recommend this game to anyone
      who grew up with games, meaning that gaming is their brain's reward
      system. For anyone who enjoys work simulators, driving games or light work
      simulators, it provides great satisfaction, without hooking you into its
      trap. I see this game as a tool to reward my brain and allow it to rest so
      it is charged to face challenges of the week ahead.
