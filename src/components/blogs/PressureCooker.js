      <h2 id="pressurecooker">Pressure cooker</h2>I am stressed. But not at all
      in a bad way. I have come to terms with it: I am going to fail. Well I
      already have failed. All I can do now is to act fast and do it well.
      <h3 id="timeforchange">Time for change</h3>
      So I am pretty bad at uni. The lack of direction has really pulled my
      grade down for the past 2 years. With the start of this year, I have
      started volunteering at <a href="http://www.oaktree.org/">Oaktree</a>, the
      largest Australian youth-run not-for-profit. What really wowed me was the
      energy people had there. People were just so friendly, bubbly and eager to
      help. This was a welcome change to my self cooped-up life. It made me
      really appreciate what I had and what difference I can make in this world.
      One thing that really drove this home was one day, out the the blue, the
      Campaigns team drove up to Batman and met up with other NGOs like World
      Vision and Oxfam to discuss our plans for the upcoming Batman bi-election.
      The idea that a young person, like me, who barely knew anything about
      Australian politics could help, with this team, affect the Victorian
      political landscape is astounding to me. This really gave me a boot in the
      ass to "git gud" as the gamers say.
      <h3 id="downwiththesickness">Down with the sickness</h3>
      Also, I got sick. Small common cold. Which, ironically, made me more
      productive for the first two weeks of uni. I stayed home for two days,
      missing lectures, which made me feel sedentary. This slingshotted me to
      work furiously to catch up, carrying me over to the following week. What
      was really funny was that, because my sinuses were blocked, the shortness
      of breath very quickly caused me to be anxious, which made me more focused
      on ensuring that I worked my ass off.
      <h3 id="systemsrevamp">Systems Revamp</h3>
      One thing I am working on for Oaktree is revamping the Campaigns team's
      communications channels. I introduced them to{" "}
      <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and{" "}
      <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. This got me thinking about my
      own systems of "communication". First I fully adopted Trello as my task
      management system. I have a "General" board for "
      <em>Getting things done</em>"-esk brain dump and one for uni work. My
      system is a To do, Doing, Done system that has the tasks move to the right
      as they are completed. This has been super helpful with keeping me on the
      ball with uni lectures and allowing me to introduce tasks that fill up
      smaller gaps of time that can help supplement my learning. For example, I
      really need to learn Python and revise C and Java. So I have just have to
      swipe over to Trello when I have some free time to go see what I have up
      next.
      <h3 id="outwiththeoldinwithnew">Out with the old, in with new</h3>I know
      the key to my success is how to keep this behaviour sustainable. The first
      thing I turned to is the media I consume. I have unsubscribed from a lot
      of my Youtube channels for gaming, and found some crazy, driven, smart
      Youtubers. Some include{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw">
        TechLead
      </a>{" "}
      and{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0qA-eDDICsRR9rPcnG7tw">
        Joma Tech
      </a>
      . I also found{" "}
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/masterlock77">Tim Ferriss</a>, both
      his Youtube and his Podcast, which is great for keeping my head sharp and
      prepared for the crazy tech world.
      <h3 id="bsing">BSing</h3>
      My CV sucks, there is nothing on my resumé for after highschool. So
      something I learnt from Joma Tech is that there are many things you can do
      to fill out the resume as long as you have done the work for it. One thing
      I am focusing on is participating in uni competitions and groups.
      Obviously they are great for learning, but it also gives a great shine to
      your resumé. I've looked at the SWIFT Institute Student Challenge and
      Autonomous Robotics Research Program already. Also I'm booked in for a
      seminar on AECOM.
      <h3 id="thingstodo">Things to do</h3>I need a haircut. It's probably the
      longest it's ever been. Also I'm still in the middle of reworking my
      evening and morning routines. I'm trying out meditation and regular
      exercise. Yeah... I'm bad about exercising. There's also plenty to revise
      from previous years, especially if I want to be able to use the knowledge
      quickly. Finally, I am going to start time tracking again. By the end of
      last year, I really fell off time tracking. I feel like now, with the
      direction my life is taking, it will be more helpful if it was even more
      specific, recording what I am doing per subject. Still not quite sure.
      Finally gotta figure out how to rest. Clouding my brain with really dense
      problem solving before sleep is horrible, and I need to find a rest day
      and make it effective.
      <p>Wish me luck, Howard</p>
