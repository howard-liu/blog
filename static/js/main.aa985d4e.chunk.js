Not going to lie, I had some late "just one more job" nights the first weekend. The effect of having generally samey sights makes special events even more surprising and memorable. I recall turning a curve, and the trees parted to reveal the Swiss Alps (I think). My jaw just dropped. It would not have been the same experience if I just saw a picture of it. There was something there that was extremely gratifying about discovering new places, similar to a road trip in real life. I love to have some audio on in the background as I drive. I prefer podcasts, but some good ol\' road trip music is great too.\xa0 After a little getting used to the controls, I could basically focus my thinking part of the brain purely on the podcast (mostly Cortex at this time) while driving almost autonomously.',n.a.createElement("h3",{id:"controls"},"Controls"),"There is some debate on which control method is best. I can't afford a steering wheel, so that's out of the question for me. And WASD is just too imprecise for this game. As I am playing on a laptop, my choices are the trackpad and the mouse. I have a Logitech M705 as my mouse of choice, which has 2 thumb buttons which I assigned to be accelerate and brake, and the scroll wheel is used for controlling the cruise control. This allows me to drive with one hand, which frees me physically and relaxes me mentally too. I definitely enjoy this method as it is similar to cruising along with an actual steering wheel. However this does have its downsides. Mainly it's the problem with the lack of stability. I like resting my wrist on the table and using that as a pivot. This is for stability during straightaways and small turns. I've turned the sensitivity as far down as I feel comfortable with for larger turns, yet the tiniest movement still turns way too much. This is important during highway driving which takes up most of the time in this game. Maybe it's just because my mouse control's not that great. I try to combat this by resting the outer side of my hand and pinky on the mousepad and using that as the pivot. But again, it\u2019s still finicky and not very fluid. So in the end I actually use the trackpad the most when driving. The trackpad solves the problem with regards to accuracy and stability because you rest your finger on the trackpad at (nearly) all times, meaning small movements with the finger is much easier and controllable than the mouse and it\u2019s much more comfortable to stay still this way. Gameplay wise, I enjoy the trackpad more. However, it does have its issues. One of them being the potential for repetitive strain injury, which I didn\u2019t feel on the mouse. I felt a bit of strain after playing a whole afternoon. I found that using the first finger to be worse than using the middle finger. Another much less significant problem is that you basically have to drive 2 handed, only 1 handed when you have cruise control set up already.",n.a.createElement("h3",{id:"review"},"Review"),"After around a month, I still find trucking just as enjoyable.
